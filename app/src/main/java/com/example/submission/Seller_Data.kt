    private val productDesc = arrayOf("The Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 is one of the cheapest phablets you can get and that will most likely put it on your radar sooner or later. It may be a mere blip if you're the kind of person who consciously avoids the extremes. But bargain hunters will probably zoom in for a closer look. And they might actually have a point. The original Redmi Note sold out in a flash back in 2014, followed by its LTE-enabled version, and the upgrade, Redmi Note 2, is wasting no time either finding a place among the record-breakers. And that's even before it was available in India, which is a traditional Xiaomi stronghold, alongside its home market of China of course.",
        "To refresh your memory Xiaomi launched the Redmi Note 3 at the turn of last year and it was powered by a MediaTek Helio X10. In the spring of 2016, a Qualcomm-driven Redmi Note 3 followed and broke the company's sales record in India. Now this full review admittedly comes a little late, but the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is still on many people's radar, so we figured a way to compare the Mediatek-powered original and the Snapdragon edition might come in handy. Besides the chipset, there's also a new camera sensor, a 16MP unit even if it is limited to 1080p video recording. Another difference is the second SIM card tray can now take microSD cards. It's the hybrid kind, which isn't ideal for people who want to have it all. Other than that, the hardware is perfectly familiar.",
        "After getting to know Xiaomi's Redmi Note 4 with Helio X20, it's time to meet the Snapdragon 625 edition. It promises better battery efficiency and thermal control thanks to a more advanced manufacturing process. But these improvements may have cost the Note 4 some of its performance punch, and we will duly explore this possibility. The Redmi Note 4 with Snapdragon 625 gets to keep the same all-metal exterior with the fancy 2.5D edges on the front glass. The 5.5 1080p screen is here to stay, as is the 13MP main camera with phase-detect autofocus. The battery is one of the highlights of the Redmi series, and the Note 4 has its whopping 4,100 mAh capacity untouched.",
        "The Redmi Note 5 Pro is Xiaomi's latest smartphone, just recently introduced to the Indian market alongside the cheaper Redmi Note 5. While the company does sell more expensive models, the Redmi Note series has always been its best-selling and most important range. As you can see, Xiaomi is clearly not messing around this year. The jump to a Snapdragon 636 alone puts it in a different league compared to its competition. It has also been paired with LPDDR4X memory, which is only seen in high-end devices. Lastly, the phone also has one of the best cameras Xiaomi has shipped on a phone.",
        "It's been almost nine months since the Redmi Note 5 series premiered, and it's already time for an upgrade. The Redmi Note 6 Pro is now official, shaking up the lineup with one of the most recognizable and controversial features on the market-a frame-to-frame display with a notch. Anyway, the Redmi Note 6 Pro isn't a massive upgrade over the Note 5 Pro, but that's to be expected given the short development cycle. The Note 6 Pro does bring a larger display fitted in the same body, but keeps the same Snapdragon 636 chipset, beefy battery, and plastic/metal design. It borrows the main camera from the Note 5 Pro AI Dual Camera edition, but the selfie photography got a boost with a new dual-camera at the front.",
        "Redmi Note 7 lineup is the first one branded only as and the sub-brand company wants to come in strong. It advertises flagship-worthy build quality, great 48MP main camera on the back and powerful enough SoC no matter which Redmi 7 device you choose - the vanilla Redmi 7, the bigger Note 7 or the Pro. The one we have with us is the Redmi Note 7 - perhaps the most sought after model due to its low price and big screen. The Redmi Note 7 is an embodiment of Xiaomi's philosophy when it comes to smartphones, and the Redmi phones have become the benchmark for mid-range devices. And one would argue that the mid-range segment has seen the biggest improvement over the years with the ever declining prices of components and tech. It will be interesting to see whether the Redmi Note 7 was able to benefit from that and whether it will match the success of its predecessors.",
        "The Redmi Note is a well-established series and each new phone follows the same book - a large screen, a snappy chipset, a good camera, and a 4,000 mAh battery. All these should be wrapped in a striking body, ran by the latest MIUI, and everything ends with an affordable price tag. Well, the Redmi Note 8 follows the recipe and has just the right ingredients so that makes it yet another excellent addition to the series. Indeed, the Redmi Note 8 comes with a large 6.3 IPS LCD screen of 1080p resolution and waterdrop-shaped notch. We would forgive you if thought this is the same panels as on the Note 7. But the Note 8's screen supports HDR10, so something has definitely changed since the last year model.",
        "Xiaomi's Redmi lineup is the crowd's favorite in markets across the world as it took over shortly after the Moto G lineup lost its magic and the latest generation Redmi Notes came early this year with major design overhaul, better processors, bigger batteries and all the MIUI 11 features at your disposal. And as always, at a reasonable price point. Today's subject of our review is the Redmi Note 9 - a device that's a close relative to the Redmi Note 9S. It feels almost as if the two handsets are just different configurations of one model. The vanilla 9, for example, is slightly more compact as it has a smaller screen, employs a MediaTek G85 SoC, has NFC in most markets and there's a resolution drop in the macro and selfie shooters.",
        "The Redmi 8A is among the cheapest of the bunch for its base version, but ideally, you'd want to step a notch up for a small premium to get the 3GB of RAM. The 8A is notably missing a fingerprint sensor and comes in pretty heavy at 188g. Is the weight really a downside when the handset packs a 5,000mAh battery? You be the judge of that, but we like high-capacity cells very much, plus the Redmi supports 18W charging (if you have a charger that can do it, though - the bundled one only outputs 10W). Since we're on the topic, the Redmi also has a USB-C port. The 8A looks particularly good for the price, and we appreciate the Gorilla Glass 5 protection.",
        "The global version of Xiaomi's Redmi 9 is known as, well, Redmi 9, and it seems like one intriguing offer right off the bat. It can easily be mistaken with the Redmi 9 Prime for the Indian market and that's okay - both phones are nearly identical - the Redmi 9 is the one with NFC, while the Prime has water-repellent coating instead.The new Redmi 9 is arguably standing closer to its Note counterpart - the Redmi Note 9 - than any of its predecessors. It has the same large 1080p screen and a very similar MediaTek chipset, and even if the cameras have seen some downgrades they cover the same focal lengths, offering mostly the same sort of versatility")
